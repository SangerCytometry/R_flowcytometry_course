# R flow cytometry course
The files and presentation from the Cytometry Core Facility flow cytometry data analysis course in R by [Christopher Hall](https://github.com/hally166).

This is the the R course I have designed to help bridge the gap between the wet lab flow cytometrist and the bioinformatician.  It is not designed as a full R course, or a full flow cytometry data analysis course.  It is intended to open the non-programmers eyes to the world of data analysis in R.

The course is designed to be three hours long.

## Contents
1. PDF presentation
2. PDF handout: Basic R and flow cytometry data analysis in R
3. R files to save typing -- "R handout.R" and "Your data.R"
4. Example FCS files: 4 files of 8 peak beads and 1 file of lymphocytes stained with 6 colours

## Instructions
Download the fcs files, read the PDF handout, and use the included scripts.
