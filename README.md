# R_flowcytometry_course
The files and presentation from the Cytometry Core Facility flow cytometry data analysis course in R by [Christopher Hall(https://github.com/hally166).

This is the the R course I have designed to help bridge the gap between the wet lab flow cytometrist and the bioinformatician.  It is not designed as a full R course, or a full flow cytometry data analysis course.  It is intended to open the non-programmers eyes to the world of data analysis in R.

**It is still in active development** (Feb2019).

## Contents
